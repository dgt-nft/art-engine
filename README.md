# DAO's Got Talent - DGT ü§©

We are a decentralized open-source art movement, building pfp NFTs with your submissions. Our work is unpredictable and innovative. Contribute your artwork to our Github repository, build collaboratively, earn tokens to vote in future rounds. Let's see what the DAO has in store for us üëÄ

We are using the power of git to build a whole new breed of pfp which evolves with the DAO. 

We are on Rinkbey, hell yeah!!üî•

## How To Guide

Artistic? Use one of our templates to create a layer for our Art Engine. These will be used to generate unique NFT art faces. All styles welcome. No one knows what the final composed image will look like, but you can shape the outcome with your submissions. Be a part of it!

Our NFTs are made up of 8 layers:

- Backgrounds (solid colours or backgrounds)
- Aura (mood!)
- Shoulders (& neck)
- Face (shapes, textures and colours)
- Face Tattoos (or markings)
- Eyes & Glasses (one or both)
- Nose and Mouth (go wild!)
- Hair / Hat / Ears / Horns (all of them, one of them ‚Äì all up to you!)

We will be accepting 10 submissions to each layer type per round. Our templates provide an outline, download and use as a guide to create your submission.

### Artwork Requirements 
- Transparent aside from your your art element
- Only PNGs
- The original template content can be removed and replaced your designs
- Keep the original dimensions (1000px by 1000px, 150dpi) 
- Keep the original file name
- Generally keep within the coloured area on the art guidelines (these are the safe areas), however, some going over the edges is OK. Designs that disregard the guide areas entirely are unlikely to be voted in. Do so at your own risk!
Use a face-on perspective for all facial features for consistency 
- Anything submitted should be copyright-free, and artwork submitted is the sole responsibility of the proposer. 

Create: you can use apps like PhotoShop Adobe CC / [sketch.io](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) / [Canva ](https://www.canva.com/)

### Process
#### Overall
Once you are happy with your artwork submit as a Pull Request on github (see guide below). Then, create a proposal to the DAO, the DAO will vote on whether to accept the submission. Successful submissions will receive DGT Tokens and a share in the DAO.

#### Creating a Pull Request on Github
1. Make sure your piece meets the requirements above
2. Visit our Github repo
3. When deciding which specific attribute to work on/ create pull request for, check that there are no [open pull requests](https://github.com/dgt-nft/art-engine/pulls)(PR) with this specific file name and artwork template. It's OK to have multiple numbes of the same attribute; ie if there is a open PR for `background1#10` creating `background2#10` is fine.
4. Create a fork of this repo on your github account
5. On your fork, create a new branch that matches the name of the attribute that you are submitting (checking there is not an open PR already).
5. Navigate to the folder in Layers ([https://github.com/rra22/art-engine/tree/main/layers](https://github.com/dgt-nft/art-engine)) which matches the layer name you have worked on
Upload your file with the identical name to the template (must include layer name, number and #10)
5. Submit and merge your attribute to the matching name on your fork (ie Hair_hat_ears_horns3#10, see https://github.com/endlessrollerblade/art-engine/commit/7c65154da514d09a41f9208aec099ad176a0c680)
6. On your forked version you will see `This branch is 1 commit ahead of dgt-nft:main.` next to this there is a contribute button, in the drop down select "Open Pull Request"


7. Commit the files, make sure you add your wallet address in the description. Name the branch the filename (as above). Click propose changes and then create Pull Request.
8. Note one attribute change per PR. 


Now you have a Pull request URL, you can move on to the next step of creating a proposal.


#### Creating a Proposal for the DAO
1. Visit our proposal page on DAOHaus (https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x4/0x2cf5f68a34cda203d2fd392457b1a9032bb59365)
2. Select ‚Äúnew proposal‚Äù then ‚ÄúRequest Shares For Work Completed‚Äù
3. Complete the proposal using this format:
    - Title: Layer Name, ie Aura1#10
    - Shares requested: 1 (you must enter '1' in this field)
    - Link: add your github Pull Request URL (as above)
    - Select 'more' and then ‚ÄúPayment Requested‚Äù 
    - Payment Requested : 100 DGT tokens
    - Then submit
Now you have submitted, the DAO will be able to vote on whether to accept your submission. If successful the pull request (PR) will be merged and you will receive the shares (1) and tokens (100).

You can now use these shares to vote in following submissions!
