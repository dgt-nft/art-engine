## How To Guide

Artistic? Use one of our templates to create a layer for our Art Engine. These will be used to generate unique NFT art pieces. No one knows what the final composed image will look like, but you can shape the outcome with your submissions. 

Our NFTs are made up of 8 layers:
- Backgrounds
- Aura
- Shoulders
- Faces
- Face Tattoos
- Eyes Glasses
- Nose and Mouths
- Hair

We will be accepting 10 submissions to each layer type. Our templates provide an outline, download and use as a guide to create your submission.

### Requirements 
- Transparent aside from your your art
- Only PNGs
- The original template content can be removed and replaced your designs
- Keep the original dimension (1000px by 1000px) 
- Keep the original file name
- Generally keep within the guideline, however some going over the edges is OK. Designs which disregard this are unlikely to be voted in
Use a head on perspective for features to be consistent 

### Process
#### Overall
Once you are happy with your artwork submit as a Pull Request on github (see guide below). Then create a proposal to the DAO, the DAO will vote on whether to accept the submission. Successful submissions will receive DGT Tokens and a share in the DAO.

#### Creating a Pull Request on Github
1. Make sure your pieces meets the requirements above
2. Visit our Github repo
3. Navigate to the folder in Layers which matches the layer name your worked
Upload you your file with the identical name to the template (must include layer name, number and #10)


4. Commit the files, make sure you add your wallet address in the description. Name the branch the filename. Click propose changes and then create Pull Request.


Now you have a Pull request URL, you can move on to the next step of creating a proposal.


#### Creating a Proposal for the DAO
1. Visit our proposal page on DAOHaus
2. Select ‚Äúnew proposal‚Äù then ‚ÄúRequest Shares For Work Completed‚Äù
3. Complete the proposal using this format:
    - Title: Layer Name, ie Aura1#10
    - Shares requested: 1
    - Link: add your github Pull Request URL
    - Select more and then ‚ÄúPayment Requested‚Äù 
    - Payment Requested : 100 DGT tokens
    - Then submit
